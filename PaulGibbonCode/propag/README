README file for DRELP - Dynamic RElativistic Laser Propagation

==============================================================


DRELP is a 2D (r,z,t) wave propagation model based on the paraxial, slowly
varying envelope approximation.  It includes diffraction, refraction,
relativistic self-focussing, electron density cavitation via the 
radial ponderomotive force, and field ionisation for hydrogen and
helium gas targets.  It does NOT include any fast-timescale or kinetic
physics such as plasma wave generation, particle acceleration, parametric
instabilities etc.  (To model these things you should use a 2D
particle-in-cell code instead.)  

DRELP offers an easily accessible, optics-based approach to
relativistic laser propagation in underdense plasmas, comparable to 
hydrodynamics modelling of laser interaction with solids.  The code
takes actual experimental laser and target conditions as input
parameters, and provides a guide to propagation behaviour near
the critical self-focussing power. 

A detailed description of the model equations, the numerical scheme
and some examples of its use in simulating relativistic laser channeling
can be found in the paper by Gibbon et al., Phys. Plasmas 2, 1305
(1995).

The present version is written in standard fortran-77 and will compile
on a standard Linux-PC with the GNU g77 compiler.  To compile, change
to the directory where the source was unpacked (eg: $HOME/propag/ )and type:

> cd src
> make drelp

If you use a different compiler (eg. ifc from Intel), you will need to
change some of the flags in the makefile accordingly.

Example scripts are provided in run_scripts/ which perform additional
chores such as creating run a directory, copying a set of input
parameters into a namelist file, and renaming some of the output
files.   These can be freely adapted to the user's needs and directory
structure. 

Before running a script, change the TOP variable to your installation
directory ($HOME/propag by default).

Run the script with, eg:

> run_scripts/vacuum
 
Sample plots generated with these scripts are provided in the example_plots/ 
directory.  The first 3 examples below use the `steady state' mode - 
infinite pulse length, variation in (r,z) only.  The last 2 include 
ionization, assume a finite pulse length, and compute the propagation
dynamics of the whole pulse in (r,z,t).

	vacuum		Gaussian beam focussed to 10			vacuum.ps
			micron spot in `vacuum' (low

	fixed-profile	Laser beam focussed onto a 'preformed',		channel+profile.ps
			finite-length plasma profile with tapered 
			edges (typical gas-jet configuration).
			Note the explosive diffractive behaviour

	ionize		Ionization defocussing in hydrogen at		ionize_hydrogen.ps
			different gas fill pressures.
