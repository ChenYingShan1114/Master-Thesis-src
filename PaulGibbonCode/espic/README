This is the README file for the Particle-in-Cell tutorial ESPIC.
---------------------------------------------------------------

ESPIC - ElectroStatic PIC - is a one-dimensional particle-in-cell
code designed for teaching purposes.  It is closely based on the model
described in the book by Birdsall & Langon.

Various versions of the code are available in both C and Fortran-90,
together with tutorial exercises of increasing complexity, providing 
training in PIC simulation of nonlinear laser-plasma simulation.
 

Compiling ESPIC
--------------

The directory structure resulting from unpacking the tar files should look
like this:

	f90		...	containing the fortran90 source code (basic version)
	C		...	containing the C source code (basic)
	master_f90	...	extended fortran90 version
	master_c	...	extended C version
	
The .gle files are scripts for the GLE plotting program.
The multiplot.gnu example file shows how to plot several graphs per page.
	
Depending on the language, the source directories contain a number of files with
.f90, .c and .h extensions.  These have the following purpose:

      espic	       Main driver program
      init	       Variable and parameter initialisation
      loadx	       Set up particle positions
      loadv	       Set up particle velocities
      push	       Update particle velocities
      boundaries       Check particle boundary conditions
      density	       Compute charge density on grid from particle positions
      field	       Compute electric field from charge density
      diagnostics      Compute/write out particle and field diagnostics	
      plots	       Write out graphical diagnostic data
      es.h	       Parameter definitions

To compile, go to the desired source directory and change the makefile 
to suit your compiler.  

For the Fortran version, type:

	cd f90
	<edit> makefile
	FC=ifort         # selects the Intel compiler
	
Then compile the code with:

	make espic
	

For the C version, type:

	cd C
	<edit> makefile
	FC=cc         # selects the default (usually GNU) C-compiler
	
Then compile the code with:

	make espic
	



Running ESPIC
